### Hi there 👋 
## I am Richard Allen White III (Rick)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on microbialites for NASA, nitrogenase for USDA, viral-like particles for industry, and Bats for NIH. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust. I ❤️ rust so much. But, I am not an expert yet. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to viruses or rust 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting better at Rust, the greatest language ever. Also, I wish my Spanish and German was better. But, my Spanish is better than my German - without a doubt
- 🥒 Pickles are amazing. I am Pickle Rick.
